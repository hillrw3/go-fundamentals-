/*
	TODO:
	Let us see if a rune is a letter in the alphabet. Write a function
	called runeInAlphabet which takes a rune and returns "capital letter" if the letter is in the English alphabet
	and "lowercase letter" if it is lowercase, and "not a letter" if it is not in the alphabet.
	HINT: Ken Thompson made this self-synchronizing design outline with Rob Pike on Sept 2, 1992 on a placemat in a New Jersey diner.
