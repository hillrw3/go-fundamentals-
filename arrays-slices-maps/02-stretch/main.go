  TODO: create a 2D slice called threeByThree which contains a length 3 slice with a 3 length slice of integers
at each index. Starting at 0, increase each grid point on the matrix by 1 such that printing threeByThree
will yield [[0,1,2] [3,4,5] [6,7,8]]. You can set them manually, but try to use two for loops.
Print each index of threeByThree. */
